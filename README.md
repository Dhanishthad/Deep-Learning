-> Churn Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting customer churn using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used is the "Churn.csv" file, which includes various customer features and a binary churn label.

-> Model Details
Data Preparation
The data preparation script (data_preparation.py) reads the Churn.csv file, performs one-hot encoding on categorical features, and splits the data into training and test sets.

-> Training the Model
The training script (train.py) trains the model using the prepared data and evaluates its performance.

-> Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy score on the test set. You can modify the evaluation metrics as needed.

-> Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any improvements or bug fixes.
